# There is a delicately timed dance happening here which is unique to Whitehall.

# +-------------+--------------------+----------+-------+
# | Production  | Push               | Full     | 00:00 |
# | Staging     | Push (+ transform) | Redacted | 00:00 |
# | Staging     | Pull               | Full     | 02:30 |
# | Integration | Pull               | Redacted | 02:30 |

# - The push_whitehall_staging_daily job redacts the Staging Whitehall database
#   in-place before dumping it to S3. Integration then pulls the redacted copy.
# - The pull_whitehall_production_daily job then overwrites Staging with the
#   latest data from Production, so Staging remains unredacted.
# - Staging has the unredacted data because it helps when debugging
#   content-related issues.
