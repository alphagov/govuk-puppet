            Enter a list of paths (space separated) to GOV.UK pages to clear
            them from CDN. Enter full URLs to clear only from CDN (such as
            items not on the main gov.uk hostname, such as assets). This
            defaults to 10 pages that were once the 10 most popular pages on
            GOV.UK according to our analytics.
