# == Define: govuk_jenkins::jobs::athena_fastly_logs_check::icinga_database_check
#
# Definition used to iterate through an array of database names and set-up
# Icinga passive checks for each one of these.
#
# This should only have to exist as a seperate defined resource until the
# eventual day that we upgrade Puppet to allow the future syntax where we
# can iterate through the array.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*jenkins_url*]
#
# A URL to the Jenkins job which is linked to by this alert. This URL will
# be given a query string to filter the jobs listed to only those for this
# particular database.
#
# [*service_description*]
#
# The description that is shown in Icinga for this check. It is expected to
# have a variable interpolated of $DATABASE, this is replaced for the database
# name that is under check.
