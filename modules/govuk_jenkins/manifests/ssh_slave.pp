# == Define: Govuk_jenkins::Ssh_slave
#
# Create an SSH slave that the Jenkins master can use to build jobs
#
# === Parameters:
#
# [*agent_hostname*]
#   The hostname of the agent that the master connects to.
#
# [*credentials_id*]
#   This is a uniquely generated ID that is created when you create a set of
#   credentials. The ID is linked to the specific Jenkins instance, so must
#   be created manually before being added to this defined type.
#
# [*labels*]
#  This string represents the labels to apply to the agent.
#
# [*description*]
#   Describe what the agent is used for.
#
# [*executors*]
#   Set how many jobs the instance can build at any one time.
#
# [*exclusive*]
#   Boolean to indicate whether or not to "Only build jobs with label
#   expressions matching this node"
#
# [*ssh_port*]
#   Set the SSH port that the master connects to.
#
# [*jenkins_home*]
#   Home directory of the Jenkins user, which also sets the root directory of
#   where builds take place.
#
# [*jenkins_user*]
#   The user which the master connects to the agent over SSH as.
