# == Define: govuk_rabbitmq::queue_with_binding
#
# Creates a RabbitMQ queue, binds it to an exchange, and monitors it.
# Users should be set up separately: when doing so, you need to include
# read/write/configure permissions for the queue.
#
# === Modifying queues and bindings
#
# The provider for the rabbitmq_binding resource identifies instances without reference to the routing key.
# This makes it rather awkward to add or change bindings on any queue which already has a binding, because the
# provider will think the binding already exists even if the routing keys differ, and will assume
# that no work needs doing.
# At present the workaround for changing a binding is to create a new queue for the new binding. Then switch the
# consumers over to the new queue, and remove the old queue.
# Another side effect of this problem is you can't define more than one binding for a queue.
# This may be fixed by https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-rabbitmq/pull/504
#
# govuk_rabbitmq::remove_queues and govuk_rabbitmq::remove_bindings can be used
# to ensure old queues and bindings are cleaned up.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*amqp_exchange*]
#   The RabbitMQ exchange to configure permissions for.
#
# [*amqp_queue*]
#   The RabbitMQ queue to create and configure permissions for.
#
# [*routing_key*]
#   The routing key to create a binding for on the RabbitMQ queue.
#
# [*durable*]
#   Queues can be durable or transient. Durable queues survive broker restart, transient queues do not.
#   (default: true)
#
