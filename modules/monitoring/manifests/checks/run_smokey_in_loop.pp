# Class: monitoring::checks::run_smokey_in_loop
#

# constantly and writes the results to a JSON file atomically. That output
# is read by Icinga for each of the check_feature resources.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*features*]
#   A hash of features that should be executed by Icinga.
# [*environment*]
#   String to pass to the tests_json_output.sh script, e.g. integration
#
