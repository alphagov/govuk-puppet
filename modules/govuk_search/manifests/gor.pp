# == Class: govuk_search::gor
#
# Dump POST traffic to file so that it can be replayed. This means we have a simple
# way to recover from failure as we can restore the last backup and then replay the
# traffic (POST requests are for data insert/update only)
#
# Also optionally replays traffic, in real-time, to a given list of
# target hosts.  This is a temporary measure so we can replay
# Whitehall and Search Admin updates from Rummager to Search API
# during the migration.
#
# Traffic can then be replayed by follow the guide at:
# https://github.com/buger/goreplay/wiki/Capturing-and-replaying-traffic
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*enabled*]
#   Boolean to determine if Search traffic will be saved; defaults to false.
#
# [*output_path*]
#   File location for files to be saved to.
#
#   If the output path contains an `_` then either the filename need to end in an `_`
#   or output-file-append needs to be set to true for the filename generation to work
#   as expected.
#
# [*replay_target_hosts*]
#   Hosts to replay traffic to; defaults to an empty list.
#
# [*port*]
#   Port to record traffic from; defaults to 3009.
