# == Class: varnish
#
# Installs varnish, a cache/web accelerator. See https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs for more info.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*default_ttl*]
#
#   The cache lifetime in seconds for items which are received from the
#   upstream service without an explicit cache lifetime header (no `Cache-Control`
#   or `Expires`). This is passed as the `-t` argument to the [`varnishd`](https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/3.0/reference/varnishd.html?highlight=default_ttl)
#   command when it is started up.
#
#   Default: 300
#
# [*strip_cookies*]
#   Whether cookies should be stripped from inbound requests and outbound responses.
#   Note that even when cookies are allowed, responses will still be cached by varnish
#   unless the upstream response contains explicit cache control headers saying not to.
#
#   Default: true
#
# [*storage_size*]
#   The amount of memory that `varnishd` will allocate using the memory-based `malloc` storage backend.
#   For full documentation see https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/3.0/reference/varnishd.html?highlight=default_ttl#storage-types
#   Default: '512M'
#
# [*upstream_port*]
#   The port of the upstream service that varnish proxies to (and caches).
#
#   Default: 3054 (the router)
#
# [*environment_ip_prefix*]
#   The first two octets of the IP range we're on.
