# == Define: icinga::check
#
# Most of these params relate to Nagios service configuration directives:
#
# http://icinga.sourceforge.net/docs/3_0/objectdefinitions.html#service
#
# === Parameters:
#
# [*ensure*]
#   Can be used to remove an existing check.
#   Default: present
#
# [*service_description*]
#   Description of the alert.
#
# [*check_command*]
#   Command used to check whether the service is healthy.
#
# [*host_name*]
#   The title of a `Icinga::Host` resource. Usually `$::fqdn`.
#
#   This is a mandatory argument because the type is typically used as an
#   exported resource. In which case the variable must be eagerly evaluated
#   when passed by the exporting node, rather than lazily evaluated inside
#   the define by the collecting node.
#
# [*check_period*]
#   The title of a `Icinga::Timeperiod` resource describing when this
#   service should be actively checked.
#
# [*graphite_hostname*]
#   The hostname of the graphite system in this enviroment.
#
# [*notification_period*]
#   The title of a `Icinga::Timeperiod` resource.
#
# [*use*]
#   The title of a `Icinga::Service_template` resource which this service
#   should inherit.
#   Default: govuk_regular_service
#
# [*action_url*]
#   Additional diagnostics URL. Typically a link to a graph in Graphite that
#   shows very recent trends for the service. This will be included in the
#   Nagios UI and email alerts.
#
# [*notes_url*]
#   Documentation URL for more information about how to diagnose the service
#   and why the alert might exist. Should link to a section of the
#   "opsmanual". This will be included in the Nagios UI and email alerts.
#
# [*linked_metric*]
#   A metric to link to in Graphite as part of the `action_url`. Overrides
#   the `$action_url` parameter if it's set.
#
# [*contact_groups*]
#   Convenience method to use in addition to the service
#   templates. This is so you can pass a group to a check without
#   having to define a new service template
#
# [*event_handler*]
#   A command to run when the check changes state
#
