# Class govuk_ci::agent::swarm
#
# Joins a jenkins agent machine to a jenkins master/cluster by downloading and invoking the swarm client.
#
# note: The jenkins master requires the swarm plugin before an agent can be assigned with this class.
#       This class requires an associated API user to be created on the jenkins master. After the user
#       has been created, you'll need to retrieve the user's API token. The API token is used in place of a
#       a password to authenticate a jenkins user with the jenkins master. An API token can be
#       found in the jenkins UI under the user's profile 'http://<JENKINS HOST>:<PORT>/user/<USERNAME>/configure'
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*fsroot*]
#   The top level directory for jenkins workspaces and other jenkins files and directories.
#   Typically $JENKINS_HOME
#
# [*agent_labels*]
#   The agent labels advertise what resources a particular jenkins agent has available.
#   This is useful if you wanted to isolate a job/task to a jenkins agent to
#   make use of any unique resouces/dependencies a particular jenkins agent may offer.
#
# [*discovery_addr*]
#   The broadcast IP address of an interface.  The swarm client uses udp to discovery to
#   discover a jenkins master on the network.
#
# [*agent_user_api_token*]
#   Used to authenticate a jenkins user with the jenkisn master.  The user is defined in:
#   'govuk_ci::master' as an 'govuk_jenkins::api_user' type.
#
#   By default, in newer versions of Jenkins you will be unable to view another
#   users token. To get past this, temporarily set the following as an argument under
#   JAVA_ARGS in the init.d script and restart the Jenkins service:
#
#   "-Djenkins.security.ApiTokenProperty.showTokenToAdmins=true"
#
#   Ref: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Features+controlled+by+system+properties
#
# [*swarm_client_package*]
#   The name of the package in our ppa (aptly repo). It also represents the name of the ppa.
#
# [*swarm_client_dest*]
#   Path to the swarm client binary.
#
# [*executors*]
#   The number of executors an agent can allocate to running jobs
